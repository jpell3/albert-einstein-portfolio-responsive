# CSCI 6655: Web-Database Application Development - Midterm Project
The objective of this project was to test my HTML and CSS knowledge. In this project, I was asked to create a portfolio website for Albert Einstein.

## Project Scenario
With the miracle of science and a time machine, scientists traveled back to the past and brought the great Albert Einstein to the present. Mr. Einstein is fascinated by everything we have in today's society because of the beauty of science. After a couple of months, Mr. Einstein wanted to return to academics and start something similar to an online learning platform, but he was having a very hard time understanding the web and how it works. Luckily, Mr. Einstein's manager found a full-stack developer to develop his project.

## Deliverables
There were two major deliverable components for this project.

### Wireframe
A wireframe was required for the website.
