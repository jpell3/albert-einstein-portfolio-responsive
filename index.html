          <h3>About</h3>
          <h2>His Life.</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="about-text">
          <span class="indent"></span>Albert Einstein was a German-born
          theoretical physicist, widely held to be one of the greatest and most
          influential scientists of all time. Best known for developing the
          theory of relativity, he also made important contributions to quantum
          mechanics, and was thus a central figure in the revolutionary
          reshaping of the scientific understanding of nature that modern
          physics accomplished in the first decades of the twentieth century.
          His mass-energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from
          relativity theory, has been called "the world's most famous equation".
          He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for his services to
          theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of
          the photoelectric effect", a pivotal step in the development of
          quantum theory. His work is also known for its influence on the
          philosophy of science. In a 1999 poll of 130 leading physicists
          worldwide by the British journal Physics World, Einstein was ranked
          the greatest physicist of all time. His intellectual achievements and
          originality have made the word Einstein broadly synonymous with
          genius.
          <br />
          <span class="indent"></span>In 1905, a year sometimes described as his
          annus mirabilis (miracle year), Einstein published four groundbreaking
          papers. These outlined a theory of the photoelectric effect, explained
          Brownian motion, introduced his special theory of relativity—a theory
          which addressed the inability of classical mechanics to account
          satisfactorily for the behavior of the electromagnetic field—and
          demonstrated that if the special theory is correct, mass and energy
          are equivalent to each other. In 1915, he proposed a general theory of
          relativity that extended his system of mechanics to incorporate
          gravitation. A cosmological paper that he published the following year
          laid out the implications of general relativity for the modeling of
          the structure and evolution of the universe as a whole. The middle
          part of his career also saw him making important contributions to
          statistical mechanics and quantum theory. Especially notable was his
          work on the quantum physics of radiation, in which light consists of
          particles, subsequently called photons.
          <br />
          <span class="indent"></span>For much of the last phase of his academic
          life, Einstein worked on two endeavors that proved ultimately
          unsuccessful. Firstly, he fought a long rearguard action against
          quantum theory's introduction of fundamental randomness into science's
          picture of the world, objecting that "God does not play dice".
          Secondly, he attempted to devise a unified field theory by
          generalizing his geometric theory of gravitation to include
          electromagnetism too. As a result, he became increasingly isolated
          from the mainstream of modern physics.
          <br />
          <span class="indent"></span>Born in the German Empire, Einstein moved
          to Switzerland in 1895, forsaking his German citizenship (as a subject
          of the Kingdom of Württemberg) the following year. In 1897, at the age
          of seventeen, he enrolled in the mathematics and physics teaching
          diploma program at the Swiss Federal polytechnic school in Zürich,
          graduating in 1900. In 1901, he acquired Swiss citizenship, which he
          kept for the rest of his life. In 1903, he secured a permanent
          position at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern. In 1905, he submitted a
          successful PhD dissertation to the University of Zurich. In 1914, he
          moved to Berlin in order to join the Prussian Academy of Sciences and
          the Humboldt University of Berlin. In 1917, he became director of the
          Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics; he also became a German citizen
          again, this time as a subject of the Kingdom of Prussia. In 1933,
          while he was visiting the United States, Adolf Hitler came to power in
          Germany. Horrified by the Nazi "war of extermination" against his
          fellow Jews Einstein decided to remain in the US, and was granted
          American citizenship in 1940. On the eve of World War II, he endorsed
          a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt alerting him to the
          potential German nuclear weapons program and recommending that the US
          begin similar research. Einstein supported the Allies but generally
          viewed the idea of nuclear weapons with great dismay.
